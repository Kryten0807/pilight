# PiLight

A Raspberry Pi powered visual alarm.

Not sure what that means? Check out
[this page](http://www.tycen.com/2013/12/sleepi.html).

Like the gentleman who wrote the blog post above, I have a small child at home
who likes to get up ridiculously early on weekend mornings. Inspired by the post
above, and by the Raspberry Pi I had at home, I put together my own version.

## A Note about this Repository

This repository follows the "gitflow" system. All the development is being done
on the develop branch (and on feature branches where appropriate). When I'm
happy with the current state, changes will be merged into the master branch. As
of this writing (12/24/2013), neither the master branch nor the develop branch
are ready for use. I'll be doing some testing later today and will (hopefully)
merge the develop branch into the master branch in time for this to be deployed
as a Christmas present.
